# Analyzing 110 years of Knoxville, Tennessee temperature data

For several years now, I’ve heard acquaintances lament: <i>We don’t have spring anymore.  We skip spring and go straight to summer.  I miss spring-like temperatures.</i>  To see if data supports this belief, I decided to analyze publicly available NOAA weather station data collected from 1910 - 2019 at the Knoxville, TN airport.

# Tools Used
* Jupyter Notebook
* R, ggplot2

# Technical Highlights
* Used R functions to improve readibility
* Used heatmaps and boxplots for data exploration
* Used textGrob to customize plot titles
* Used R if-stop statements to validate data along the way
* Used readr::read_csv to get data from CSV file

# Summary of Findings
* There is evidence to support the perception that summer-like temperatures from April 1 to May 31 have happened more frequently since 2005 in Knoxville, TN. 

# Getting Started
* Introduction in notebook contains reason for analysis, the terms used to define the bounds of the problem, and data source details.
* The data (CSV file) is included in the repo.
* All required packages are in one cell at the top of the notebook.
